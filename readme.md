A no-bullshit (and not yet complete) Wordpress framework utilizing Bootstrap 3, live LESS processing, Theme Customizer integration, and loads of un-styled functions and components to make Soren child theme creation fun and robust.

== Description ==
Soren was built for those developers who are sick of unstyling the parent framework, for those who are sick of clients wrecking their designers, and for those who long for something sleak, slender, powerful, and robust. Something that was built by some super high standards (either that or I'm really fuckin OCD).
